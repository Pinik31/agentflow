Implement the following improvements to my website to enhance functionality, usability, and AI integration. Ensure that all updates follow best practices, modern UI/UX standards, and scalable solutions.

Feature Enhancements & Fixes:

1. Chatbot Close Button & Structured Data Handling

Add a close button for the chatbot so users can dismiss it when needed.
Ensure that all user interactions with the chatbot are collected in a structured format that can be easily used by AI agents for automation and decision-making.
Use the best method for structuring and storing chatbot data, ensuring smooth AI agent interaction. (Example: JSON format stored in a database like Supabase, or suggest the best alternative).
If necessary, implement API integrations or local storage solutions to ensure smooth and secure data retrieval.
2. Blog Section Fix & Clickable Blog Posts

Ensure that blog posts are clickable and fully functional.
When a user clicks on a blog post, it should open in a dedicated page that displays the full content, images, author details, and related posts.
Implement pagination or filtering options to improve blog navigation if needed.
3. Relevant Images for All Content Sections

For every segment that requires an image, generate or retrieve high-quality, relevant images that align with the content.
Ensure that images are properly sized and optimized for fast loading (use lazy loading if necessary).
If applicable, suggest AI-generated images or royalty-free image APIs to automate this process.

Use modern JavaScript/React practices to ensure smooth chatbot UI interaction.
Use Supabase, Firebase, or a structured API for chatbot data storage.
